# Creational Patterns  

## Factory Method
The main roles are **Product** and **Factory** in this pattern.  
But the product and a factory are abstract concepts, we need concrete concepts.  
In my sample, I used **drink** and **drink shop** as "Concrete Product" and "Concrete Factory" to implement **Factory Method Pattern**.
